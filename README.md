# Description
Right now, this is a very basic web application. There is a basic front-end file (index.jade) that acts as a login.
There is a SQL database that holds the user data. So far, the frameworks have been set up and decided.

## Frameworks
- ExpressJS as the back-end that handles client requests
- Sequelize as an ORM to make working with the SQL database easier
- Sqlite as the DBMS
