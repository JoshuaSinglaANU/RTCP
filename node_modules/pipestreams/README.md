# PipeStreams

PipeStreams use [pull-stream](https://github.com/pull-stream/pull-stream)s as infrastructure to realize
rather performant streaming in NodeJS. The main purpose for PipeStreams is to facilitate the building of
streaming applications; in other words: to provide a simple and clear API to minimize mental overhead.

While PipeStreams as such are not directly compatible with 'classical' NodeJS push-style streams, one can
always interface the two using a number of adaptors to maintain interoperability.

PipeStreams encourages and simplifies the use of classical command line (shell/bash) tools to boost
performance.
